## Introduction
Saliency detection is crucial for various computer vision tasks. In this work, we introduce a novel approach that utilizes bilateral feature fusion combined with hexagonal attention to achieve robust performance in uncertain and dynamic environments.

## Method
Our method comprises two main components:
- **Bilateral Feature Fusion**: Combines multi-scale features to enhance robustness against varying conditions.
- **Hexagonal Attention**: Captures spatial dependencies using a unique hexagonal pattern, improving attention accuracy in complex environments.

## Availability
The full codebase will be publicly released after the paper's acceptance and publication. It will support training, evaluation, and reproducibility of the results reported in the paper.

## License
This project will be licensed under the MIT License upon release.
