## Introduction
Saliency detection is crucial for various computer vision tasks. In this work, we introduce a novel approach that utilizes bilateral feature fusion combined with hexagonal attention to achieve robust performance in uncertain and dynamic environments.

## Method
The detailed logics and descriptions of the method will be also made available to the research community.

## visual uncertainities and dynamic environments
The role of visual uncertainities will be explained in more detail with visual samples.

## Results 
The empirical analysis, including performance metrics and qualitative samples across all evaluated datasets, will be made publicly available for the research community. This will enable qualitative comparison and further analysis by other researchers upon the publication of the paper.


## Availability
The full codebase will be publicly released after the publication. It will support training, evaluation, and reproducibility of the results reported in the paper.

## License
This project will be licensed under the MIT License upon release.
